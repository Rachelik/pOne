Story goes back to 10+ years ago during my first programming class (c++).
During the first lesson, my code doesn't work at all. It is a bad experience.
I am not able to progress through the lesson because I mistakenly typed a . for , or a , for . which I spent the whole time looking at the code of why nothing runs and considered missing out the whole lesson to it.
Instructor can't find where I go wrong because a . and , is really hard to spot and stopped looking because the class still needs to go on. 
I spent after class hour to check where I went wrong, only to find it. I checked line by line against the worksheet.
Moral of the story: Do it right line by line. Here are the symbols and numbers for practice to people like me.
